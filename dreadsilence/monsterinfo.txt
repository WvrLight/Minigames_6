      - during this duration, its movement speed while nearby blood trails is greatly increased
      - hitting a survivor will end the duration
(for this power to work, each blood trail must be an armor stand with a scoreboard value that is the same as a player's scoreboard value)
- BELCHER
      - can channel its power for X seconds, can release after channeling to launch fire projectiles in the direction its looking, fire remains for Y seconds
      - survivors that are hit by the fire are hit by X damage, and gain fire damage immunity for a short duration
      - the belcher can walk through the fire, but is slowed
- PLAGUEBEAST
      - can launch a toxic orb projectile, when it lands on the ground, 
      - it will explode after X seconds, or when a survivor or the plaguebeast walks near it
      - any survivor in the area of effect will be slowed and cause a specific sound, no effect on plaguebeast
